        My first project I had going on was a simple HTML & CSS only website. I built it to practice what I have learned in the first two courses I took, HTML5 and CSS3

          Oh it definitely did. A lot of the concepts I had in mind as theories and thought that it was <span style="color: #ff0000;">"easy"</span> was proven the opposite. The website challenged not only my knowledge, but my patience, consistency, and will to make this work. After all I had never coded anything from scratch and to do so was eye opening to many concepts from Web Dev to personal effort.

          <p class="big-img-text">I had ton of fun in turning stuff <span style="color: #ff0000;">"3D"</span> and definitely a hard time figuring out positioning and the concept of an absolute position</p>

            The navigation bar on that website was single handedly  responsible for so many breakdowns and face slams. I remember it took two days just because I would refuse to continue it as all I had in mind was "my code made sense so why wouldn't it work", which would only last to the next day where I would I discover what a non-sense it actually is. And at the end, it turned out just fine and was definitely worth every second of anger wasted on it.

          <p class="small-img-text">
            However at that point I knew nothing of responsive design, therefore I wasn't able to do anything regarding its display on smaller screens, leading it to look like the atrocity you see in front of you. I tried my best to not hard code anything for the sake of responsivity, but this is all I could pull off at that time.

          <p class="big-img-text">The website doesn't offer much, just me trying to fit as much random content as possible to make it entertaining in any way shape or form. Yet it's simplicity that makes me smile every time I enter the link and "what was I thinking" is what usually follows in mind </p>
