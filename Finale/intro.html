I'm ought to join this virtual science club thing, wanna tackle along ?" and my bored self thought to himself "why not ? what could possible go wrong ?" and to his <span style="color: #ff0000;">(and my)</span> surprise, everything went wrong....... Just kidding it went butter smooth and got me here eventually.</p>

          <p>As mentioned before, this little journey of mine started with a simple text. Summer of 2020 was a weird time, corona was at it's peak, Lebanon's crisis was starting to unravel, and everything was going downhill. I had no idea what I was doin, picking small things here and there and losing interest after a day or two, everything felt boring and "not worth it". Until I got that small text "Hey blablabla science club blablabla fun and prizes blablabla wanna tackle a long ?". I remember taking a good 5 seconds looking at the text and thinking to myself "Am I that bored ?" and the answer was yes, yes I was.</p>

          <p>I joined the club and was instantly blown away of how much dedication the owners had put into it. It was a Lebanese/Algerian based and had partnered with the U.S.A. Embassy itself. We picked on the projects we were competing with <span style="color: #ff0000;">(my partner decided to pick two thinking we're some scientists)</span> and met up monthly to discuss interesting scientific topics, accompanied by equally interesting guests. Eventually we presented our projects and surprisingly our 2nd project was the one to win us second place. The whole club phase was an interesting one for sure, as I met some of the most intelligent people out there, and had the chance to discuss my passion for science with them. <br> Special Thanks to Nisreen and Sabine for this experience.</p>

          <div class="coursera-text hover-text rd-text">
            <p>Landing second place won us the opportunity to work with the Embassy ourselves, a prototype Lingo to practice on <span style="color: #ff0000;">( it came in a cute package )</span> and most importantly the Coursera sponsorship. I soon signed up for the Web Dev specialization degree and got started. Going through the lectures and taking notes was definitely my favorite thing to do, it felt so free and independent from traditional school, and course after course I was led here !</p>
